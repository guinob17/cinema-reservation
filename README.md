# cinema-reservation

Made with Node.js

The main objective is to develop a program that simulates the reservation of seats in a cinema. There will be 10 chairs in total. When the user chooses his chair, it should be shown which chairs are free and which are occupied. If the user chooses a chair that is already occupied, a message should notify him that his option has already been chosen and should ask if he wants to choose another one. The program will be closed when the user chooses not to choose more chairs.
